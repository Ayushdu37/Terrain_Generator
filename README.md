# 🌄 Procedural Terrain Generator

A simple **3D terrain generator** built with [Processing](https://processing.org/) using **Perlin noise**.  
It creates an animated landscape that continuously scrolls, simulating flying over mountains.

---


## 🚀 Features
- Procedural terrain generation with Perlin noise  
- Dynamic “flying” effect for endless animation  
- Adjustable parameters for scale, height, and speed  
- Rendered in 3D using `P3D`

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/).  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terrain-generator.git


3. Open `terrain-generator.pde` in Processing.
4. Hit the **Run ▶** button.

## 🔧 Parameters

You can tweak these values at the top of the code to change the terrain look:

* `scl` → scale of each grid cell
* `w`, `h` → terrain width & height
* `flying` → animation speed
* `map(noise(...), 0, 1, -180, 180)` → terrain height range
